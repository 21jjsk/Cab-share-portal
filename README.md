# The requirement for a cab sharing portal

- Students of my College rely on car pooling in the starting and ending of semesters to make their journey to and from Campus to Airports/Railway station/Bus stations
- They usually use postings on FB to find people to share cabs with
- This process is inefficient and disorganised
- This application is streamlines the process and aggregates people with their source and destination and expected timeframe of departure.


# How it works
- The application is easy to use, students register with their details
- The user can login  with their registered credentials
- They can add a trip by specifying their source and destination and time frame they wish to depart.
- They can browse all trips by specifying source, destination, time frame and find other people's trip details if they fall in the overlapping timeframe
- The contact details will be included in the results and they can contact other people they wish to share a ride with
- If a person wishes to not get contacted by others and not be shown in search results anymore, they can make their trip as finished in the dashboard.
- Users can also update and delete their trip
- In addition they can also, search for cabs matching their time slot and contact the driver and book their cabs in advance. It is important to note that this is not a real time cab booking feature. Its just a tool to find cabs that are registered in the portal by an Admin. 
- Admin can add cab details like license plate number, make and model, capacity and Driver name and number, as well as where the driver is available to take bookings and at what times.
